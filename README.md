# Paper Plant Synth - Sound Generation with ATtiny85

Paper Plant Synth is a simple sound generation project that leverages the ATtin85 microcontroller to interpret analog signals from a plant sensor and play back a square wave. A galvonometer based sensor (555 timer) captures tiny electrical pulses from plants, maps these signals to a frequency range and outputs a square wave to the speakers. 

# Software Requirements

You will need Arduino IDE Classic. 
ATtiny85 support for the Arduino IDE. Guide


# Get Started
1. Clone or download this GitHub repository to your local machine
```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/TinySound.git
```
2. Open the Arduino IDE and install the ATtiny85 core as mentioned in the Software Requirements section.
3. Connect your ATtiny85 microcontroller and other hardware components following the wiring diagram provided in the project.
4. Open the project's Arduino sketch (.ino file) in the Arduino IDE.
5. Compile the code and upload it to the ATtiny85 microcontroller.
